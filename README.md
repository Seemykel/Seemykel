## Hi there ðŸ‘‹# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Seemykel

I'm a front-end developer focused on building top-notch, relatable websites that people actually enjoy using. 
I care about clean design, smooth interactions, and making sure everything works beautifully on every screen.

What I Do
- Build responsive, accessible user interfaces
- Turn design ideas into real, working websites and apps
- Focus on the details that make digital experiences feel human

Right now, Iâ€™m working with tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS â€” but Iâ€™m always learning and open to trying whatever helps get the job done better.

A Few Projects
- Personal portfolio site to share my work and story
- A mobile-first web app built with React and Tailwind
- A custom UI kit for faster, more consistent development
