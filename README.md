👋 Hey, I'm Seemykel

I'm a front-end developer focused on building top-notch, relatable websites that people actually enjoy using. 
I care about clean design, smooth interactions, and making sure everything works beautifully on every screen.

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🖥️ Build responsive, accessible user interfaces
- 🔧 Turn design ideas into smooth, working websites and apps
- 🎯 Focus on the little details that make a big difference

I mostly work with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS — but I'm always learning and open to new tools that make the web better.

## 🧩 Projects I'm Proud Of
- 🌐 A personal portfolio to share what I’ve built and what I’m about
- 📱 A mobile-first web app built with React + Tailwind
- 🧱 A custom UI kit for fast, consistent development

## 🌱 Always Growing
I’m always learning — whether it’s refining my CSS, exploring new JavaScript patterns, or just getting better at making websites feel more human.
